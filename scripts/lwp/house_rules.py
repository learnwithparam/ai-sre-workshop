WHY THIS EXISTS

`house-rules.md` banned 20 phrases. `check-prose.py` checked 6. Fourteen of them were
enforced by nothing, and nobody could see that, because the doc and the gate were two
independent lists that had to be kept in step by hand. Rules 1, 2, 6 and 7 had no
executable enforcement at all.

So the lists are not restated here. They are PARSED OUT OF `house-rules.md` at import
time. Adding a word to the doc arms it in the same edit, and the two cannot disagree
because there is only one of them. If the doc's shape changes so the parse returns
nothing, that is a hard error rather than a silently empty rule: an empty subject is how
a check passes for the wrong reason.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO

  Rule 1  counts in narrative copy         auto
  Rule 2  positional references            auto
  Rule 3  em/en dashes                     auto   (check-prose.py owns the file-level
                                                   machinery for this one; see below)
  Rule 4  **bold** in JSX-bound strings    auto
  Rule 5  AI slop words and phrases        auto
  Rule 6  generic claims                   auto
  Rule 7  sentence case                    auto
  Rule 8  links resolve                    NOT HERE. link_health.py already does it.
  Rule 9  clarity beats cleverness         model-judged, and declared as such
  Rule 10 simple English                   model-judged, and declared as such, except its
                                           `**Banned idioms**` list, which fails with --voice
  Rule 11 one idea per sentence            auto, ONLY with --voice. It is not in CHECKS: the
                                           ceilings fail 102 of 136 blog files and all 15
                                           vault notebooks today, and score_landing.py and
                                           check-prose.py import this module.

  Rule 12 name a thing by its standard   auto, ONLY with --terms. The banned paraphrases are the
          term, never a paraphrase          `- **term**: not "a", "b"` lines under Rule 12, parsed like the
                                           slop lists. They are about slides and drawings, so a blog that
                                           says "a folder" must not fail: it is opt-in, like --voice.

Rules 9 and 10 are the two a regex would get wrong in the expensive direction: it would
either pass every clever headline or fail every good one. They are reported as
`model-judged` so they can never quietly count as clean.
